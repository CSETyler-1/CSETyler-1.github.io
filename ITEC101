        <h2>1. Integrity</h2>
        <p>
            Integrity means being honest and doing the right thing even when no one is watching.
            This value comes from my upbringing and observing role models who valued honesty.
            Integrity is important to me because it builds trust and respect.
            Without integrity, relationships and reputations can be damaged.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Discipline</h2>
        <p>
            Discipline is the ability to stay focused and committed to goals and responsibilities.
            This value comes from personal routines, education, and learning the importance of self-control.
            Discipline is important because it helps me stay organized and achieve long-term success.
            Without discipline, it becomes easy to procrastinate and fall short of goals.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Respect</h2>
        <p>
            Respect means valuing others opinions, time, and differences.
            This value comes from interacting with people from different backgrounds.
            Respect is important because it creates healthy relationships and cooperation.
            Without respect, conflicts and misunderstandings are more likely to occur.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Perseverance</h2>
        <p>
            Perseverance is the ability to keep going despite challenges.
            I learned this value through personal struggles and academic challenges.
            It is important because it helps me achieve long-term goals.
            Without perseverance, giving up too easily can prevent success.
